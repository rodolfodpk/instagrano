# Production Guide

Best practices and considerations for deploying Instagrano to production.

## Caching Considerations

### Redis Cluster Setup
- Use Redis Cluster for high availability and horizontal scaling
- Configure multiple Redis nodes for failover
- Set up Redis Sentinel for automatic failover
- Monitor Redis memory usage and eviction policies

### Cache Monitoring
- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust TTL based on data freshness requirements
- Set up alerts for low cache hit rates (< 60%)
- Track cache memory usage and eviction patterns
- Monitor Redis connection pool health

### Cache Invalidation
- Consider event-based invalidation for critical real-time data
- Implement cache warming strategies for critical data
- Set up Redis persistence (AOF or RDB) for cache warm-up on restart
- Use cache tags for selective invalidation

## Logging Best Practices

### Log Aggregation
- Use JSON format for log aggregation systems (ELK, Fluentd, Splunk)
- Set up centralized logging with log shipping
- Configure log retention policies based on compliance requirements
- Implement log rotation to prevent disk space issues

### Log Levels
- Set appropriate log levels (info for production, debug for development)
- Use structured logging for better searchability
- Implement log sampling for high-volume endpoints
- Set up log-based alerting for errors and performance issues

### Monitoring Metrics
- Monitor request duration, error rates, and cache hit rates
- Set up dashboards for key performance indicators
- Track user engagement metrics (views, likes, comments)
- Monitor database connection pool and query performance

## Database Considerations

### PostgreSQL Optimization
- Configure connection pooling (PgBouncer recommended)
- Set up read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Implement database partitioning for large tables
- Monitor slow queries and optimize indexes

### Backup Strategy
- Implement automated database backups
- Test backup restoration procedures regularly
- Set up point-in-time recovery (PITR)
- Configure cross-region backup replication

## Performance Optimization

### Application Performance
- Redis caching provides significant speedup for cached feed requests
- Zap logger provides improved performance over standard library logging
- Zero-allocation logging reduces GC pressure
- Request correlation IDs enable distributed tracing

### Infrastructure
- Use CDN for static assets and media files
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) for Kubernetes
- Set up load balancing for multiple application instances
- Configure auto-scaling groups for cloud deployments

### Monitoring
- Monitor cache memory usage and eviction policies
- Track application memory usage and garbage collection
- Set up performance budgets for API response times
- Monitor database query performance and slow queries

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Use strong JWT secrets (rotate regularly)
- Implement JWT token expiration and refresh
- Set up rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Consider implementing OAuth2 for third-party integrations

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Set up security headers (CORS, CSP, HSTS)

### Infrastructure Security
- Use VPCs and security groups for network isolation
- Implement secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Set up intrusion detection and monitoring
- Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning

## Deployment Strategies

### Container Deployment
- Use multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
- Implement health checks and readiness probes
- Set up rolling deployments with zero downtime
- Configure resource limits and requests

### Environment Management
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Set up blue-green or canary deployments
- Configure automated rollback procedures

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Set up automated security scanning
- Configure automated deployment to staging/production
- Implement deployment approval workflows

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Application Monitoring
- Set up APM tools (New Relic, DataDog, AppDynamics)
- Monitor application performance metrics
- Track business metrics (user engagement, content creation)
- Set up custom dashboards for key metrics

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Track database performance and connection metrics
- Monitor Redis performance and memory usage
- Set up infrastructure alerts and notifications

### Alerting Rules
- Set up alerts for high error rates (> 1%)
- Monitor response time degradation (> 2s p95)
- Alert on low cache hit rates (< 60%)
- Set up database connection pool exhaustion alerts

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Design for stateless application instances
- Use external session storage (Redis)
- Implement database read replicas
- Set up load balancing and auto-scaling

### Vertical Scaling
- Monitor resource utilization and scale accordingly
- Optimize database queries and indexes
- Implement caching strategies for expensive operations
- Use connection pooling for database connections

### Data Scaling
- Implement database partitioning for large tables
- Consider data archiving strategies
- Set up data retention policies
- Plan for data migration and schema changes
